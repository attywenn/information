        <div class="personal-info">
                <p>Originally, <strong>Wency</strong> as his given name, <strong>Herrera</strong> as his middle name, and <strong>Pocong</strong> as his last name.
                He is known for being politically active person inside and outside the social media.
                Back in 2022, he is known for being <i>Marcos apologist</i> or being symphatizer of the Marcoses,
                but when in 2024, he woke up in reality and he joined the socio-political youth
                organization, the Kabataan Partylist - NCR. <br><br>
                
                Since he was young, he shows his interest in astronomical physics and had his dream to become an <strong>astrophysicist</strong>,
                but when turned senior high school and started to listen to social and alternative news, he began to pursue a competitive 
                program in every universities, the <strong>Bachelor of Arts in Journalism</strong>. 

                Unfortunately, he was unable to pursue his dream program at the only university where he enrolled, the <strong>Polytechnic
                University of the Philippines - Sta Mesa</strong>.<br><br>

                After that failure to step into his dream, Wency never gave up. Instead of thinking to stop to pursue his college career, 
                he enrolled to EARIST Manila, taking <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong>, continuing his
                elementary days' dream even not to be an astrophysicist, he will become a part of STEM field which physics belongs. <br><br>
                
                Now, Wency is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at <strong>EARIST Manila</strong>, taking short courses at the 
                <strong>University of the Philippines Open University</strong>, and learning lessons from the people. For Wency, learning from the
                people, especially from the marginalized, will serve as an eye opener, especially for those hated, or unseen
                good side of every story. <br><br>

                Wency now knows the upsides and downsides of everything, because he opened his eye in everything existing. He is now happy with
                his current girlfriend named <strong>Shainna Alcantara</strong>, which his internet friend since the COVID-19 outbreak, and now his lover.
